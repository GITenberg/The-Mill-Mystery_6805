description: Early detective novelist Anna Katharine Green was a unique writer in
  several respects, including the fact that many of the detectives featured in her
  novels are women. In The Mill Mystery, protagonist Constance Sterling takes on the
  seemingly impossible task of uncovering the true culprits behind the drowning death
  of a popular young pastor who is believed to have killed himself.
